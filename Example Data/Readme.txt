These 2 csv files are generated by the function "Data_Generation.m" under the settings of "Example.mlx" .

The sizes of them:
size(R) = 150 * 180;
size(fac) = 3 * 150;


code for data generation:

% Set your portfolio and sample size (p,N)
pNpairs = [180,150];p=pNpairs(1);N=pNpairs(2);
% Set your Tracking Error Constraint
TEC = 0.5;
% Set your Weights Constraint, first the constrained assets, then the constraint value
oneR = [ones(10,1);zeros(p-10,1)];
wx = 0.2;

% 3-Factors
flag=3; k=3;
% The following data loading can be replaced by user's own data, such as FF-factors or Q factors.
mu_b=[-0.1,0.1,0.1];%kx1
factor_loading_b=mvnrnd(mu_b,0.1.*eye(3),p);
% the factors follow AR(1) process f_t=mu_f+alpha f_t-1+e
