These 2 csv files are generated by the function "Data_Generation.m" under the settings of "Example.mlx" .

The sizes of them:
size(R) = 150 * 180;
size(fac) = 3 * 150;


code for data generation:

% Set your portfolio and sample size (p,N)
pNpairs = [180,150];p=pNpairs(1);N=pNpairs(2);
% Set your Tracking Error Constraint
TEC = 0.2;
% Set your Weights Constraint, first the constrained assets, then the constraint value
oneR = [ones(10,1);zeros(p-10,1)];
wx = 0.2;
%3-Factors
flag=1;k = 3;
%Generate Example Data Input Parameters 
% factor loadings
beta_total=mvnrnd([0.001,0.001,0.001],0.1.*eye(3),p);
% factor follows AR(1)
bf = [0.005,0,0;0,0.005,0;0,0,0.005];% B Ft + et
mu_f=[0.005,0.005,0.005]';%kx1
cov_f = eye(3);
[R_total,mu_pop_total,V_total,~,~,fac_total]=Data_Generation(p,N,flag,beta_total,bf,mu_f,cov_f);
%R: excess return, fac: factor, res: factor model residual. You can replace R, fac and res with own data
beta=beta_total(1:p,:); %pxk
R=R_total(1:N,1:p);mu_pop=mu_pop_total(1:p);V=V_total(1:p,1:p);
inv_Sigma_pop=inv(V);fac=fac_total(:,1:N);
res= R-fac'*((fac*fac')\fac*R); %obtain (factor model) residual
