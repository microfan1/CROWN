These 2 csv files are generated by the function "Data_Generation.m" under the settings of "Example.mlx" .

The sizes of them:
size(R) = 150 * 180;
size(fac) = 3 * 150;


code for generation(Mainly Settings):

% Set your portfolio and sample size
pNpairs = [180,150];p=pNpairs(1);N=pNpairs(2);
% Set your Tracing Error Constraint
TEC = 0.2;
% Set your Weights Constraint
